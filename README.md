# Mid Heavy - Main Site

### Overview

The Mid Heavy main site serves as the primary project our team is builind to get better at CD/CI, Version management and emulation of a professional coding environment.

We hope to develop this into a proper portfolio / blog style site to make a client facing expo of our work, current endeavours and future goals. We also envision a semi frequent style / technology change to the site to keep it fresh.
