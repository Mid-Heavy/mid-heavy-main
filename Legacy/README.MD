# Mid Heavy - Main Site

### Overview

Presently the Mid Heavy main site serves as the primary project by which our team will learn to work together. Version management and emulation of a professional atmosphere are the objective.

Otherwise, we hope to develop this into a proper portfolio / blog style site to make a client facing expo of our work, current endeavours and future goals.

### Specs

In its current iteration, the MH website is a splash page for our fancy logo! Netlify is hooked up to automatically update with every new version.

You can visit the page anytime at www.midheavy.tech
